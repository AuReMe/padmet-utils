Description:
From a file containing a list of reaction, return the pathways where this reactions 
are involved.
ex: if rxn-a in pwy-x => return, pwy-x; all rxn ids in pwy-x; all rxn ids in pwy-x FROM the list; ratio

usage:
    get_pwy_from_rxn.py --reaction_file=FILE --padmetRef=FILE  --output=FILE

options:
    -h --help     Show help.
    --reaction_file=FILE    pathname of the file containing the reactions id, 1/line 
    --padmetRef=FILE    pathname of the padmet representing the database.
    --output=FILE    pathname of the file with line = pathway id, all reactions id, reactions ids from reaction file, ratio. sep = "\t"
